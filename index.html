      <h1> Experience ⚗️</h1>
      <p>With all due respect I know that every company is looking for some very experienced web devs with yrs of experience but what I say is this:
        yes I am willing to learn, yes I am willing to stay overtime, I am willing to be humble and polite and Most of all, I am the hardest working person in the room, but also smart working person.
        I am not the best but I am not a quitter. I will finish every task in time, I am sociable and patience with my teammates.
        I have 2 yrs working on companies but I worked a lot on personal projects.
      </p>

    <div class="container c1" id="section5">
      <h1> Projects 📽️</h1>
      <p>I am currently working with a great team to develop an amazing web app like kahoot.com, why? Because I believe in education and I love kids and I really wanna take them from fortnite and COD and offer them big prizes if they pass quizzes about any subject like: science, biology, history, BIBLE.
        But let me offer some links to my last couple projects. My first project ever with MEAN STACK, was couple yrs ago and is an ig clone pls do not laugh at me :)) it was a quick funny project <a href="http://fineas-berindei.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/"> IG_CLONE</a>. Wordpress-with wordpress I build a LOT of websites for companies like: hospitals, restaurants, dentists, real estate <a href="http://visanplastconstruct.com/">Real estate wp</a> . Also I developed by myself an web app for my bachelor project which was a Angular web app with login apis chatting section and a large database of information about any subject where students could download and use in software like Mathlab and such things. These are outdated projects I am working with async pipes, services, login components and more. </p>
